**The Tortoise Webcomic** is a series of elephant jokes, except that it is a webcomic about tortoises. Sometimes it parodies Star Trek, sometimes religion or politics, and quite often itself. It is supposed to be a humor comic based on independent-ish strips, but because it is fun to regard everything in it as canon, it has started creating itself a convoluted plot against the author's plans. The Tortoise Webcomic is published every Tuesday as long as the author remembers and cares.

The author, **Mieli "SurrealPartisan" Luukinen** is a Finnish queer and autistic biophysicist/neuroengineer currently working on their Ph.D. On their free time, they play tabletop RPGs and computer games, swim, collect books (and sometimes, rarely, read them), dabble in font design and of course write and draw The Tortoise Webcomic. They can't separate their politics from their art, and you shouldn't either.
