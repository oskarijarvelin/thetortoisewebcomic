**2025-08-26:** Nice is a city in France. This strip is not named after that. Also, last week I said I wanted to start an avantgarde group. Well, I did. More about that later, probably.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Panurge is standing on a platform, reciting a poem to a microphone. They say "I love you so very much / and would like to sixty-nine / but you deny me even a touch / and say you'll never be mine."

Panel 2:

Panurge continues the poem, saying "That's why I throw a fit / and let out an angry hiss! / My pants are full of shit / aaaaand there's also piss."

Panel 3:

Panurge bows to a huge applause and lots of clapping. From the outside of the panel, someone shouts "Bravo!" and someone "Wooo!"
