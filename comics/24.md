**2024-10-08:** The Tortoise Webcomic is back! It's been over a year! I'm sure everyone has been on their toes, just waiting to get answers to such burning questions as: where is the Tortoise President? What crime were Noodles accused of? What is the meaning of life? Do socks taste better than they smell? Some of these questions will be answered in the coming strips!

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Redcap says to the Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater: "Hey, now that the noodles are free, they have opened a restaurant called The Noodle Restaurant. Do you want to go with me?" Ball-Eater answers: "Sure! Me eat balls there!"

Panel 2:

Ball-Eater is at a counter, their legs elongated. On the other side of the counter are Noodles. "Meatballs, please!", says Ball-Eater. "Conimg", answer Noodles.

Panel 3:

Redcap and Ball-Eater are at a table. On the table are two plates. The plate in front of Redcap has lettuce, and Ball-Eater's plate has meatballs. "By the way, how do you, as a 2D being, eat balls that by definition are three-dimensional?", asks Redcap, to which Ball-Eater answers: "Eagerly"
