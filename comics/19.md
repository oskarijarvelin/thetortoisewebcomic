**2023-04-25: **That vegetarian lifestyle the banana mentions of course doesn't apply to the Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Tortoise Newstortoise is interviewing a banana that holds an assault rifle. There are more bananas outside the panel. I blame the lack of space, but really I'm just too lazy to draw them.

Newstortoise says "The Banana Republic has sent troops to Tortuga to participate in the revolutionary conflict. Banana soldier, which side are you on, the revolution or the government?"

Panel 2:

Zoom to the face of the banana, showing an evil smile. The banana says "Neither. We hate your vegetarian lifestyle and are just using the chaos to kill every tortoise we can. Speaking of which, now we are going to kill you."

Panel 3:

Extreme zoom to the Newstortoise's face. In their eye there is a red skull. They say "It seems I need to unleash the power of the media (and necromancy) in order to survive..."
