**2023-05-09:** If you want to debate media neutrality or DVD deadness, you can access my Discord server via Patreon.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Tortoise Newstortoise is standing atop a bloody banana corpse, using it as The News Box. Agent 1028 is talking to them: "Tortoise Newstortoise! As a member of the media, you are neutral on politics. Also, you are the most vicious killer I know. Will you join our quest to save the Tortoise President?"

Text box: "The Tortoise Webcomic is a work of fiction. In reality there is no such thing as neutral media."

Panel 2:

Tortoise Newstortoise says "My answer would otherwise be an enthusiastic yes, but you seem to have Catopus on your team. I cannot co√∂perate with my nemesis!"

Behind Agent 1028 Catopus says "Hello!"

Panel 3:

Agent 1028 says "I'll give you my Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVD box if you join us!"

Tortoise Newstortoise points at them and says "We have a deal!"

Text box: "As a necromancer, Tortoise Newstortoise collects dead things, such as DVDs."
