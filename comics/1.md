Panel 1:

Text box: "On the bridge of TSS Anthropic Principle captain Yrjö-Koskinen has the conn (notice the professional use of naval slang). Also Spock is there."

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen, a tortoise wearing a green officer's cap with a red star, is leaning on a box labeled The Conn. Behind them, Spock, a tortoise with eyebrows and the name Spock written on their shell, says: "I am Spock."

Panel 2:

Text box: "Suddenly on the viewscreen:"

Spock answers: "Captain, you mean penal".

Text box: "To be continued..."
