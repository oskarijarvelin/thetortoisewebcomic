**2025-12-02:** Well, there was an accidental two-week break in publishing the comic. Also, this strip was the last one in my buffer for now. I'll draw new ones ASAP. I have no intention to end *The Tortoise Webcomic* here, as I have many great plans for the future. However, I cannot guarantee a weekly strip in the near future. We'll see how it goes.

The ancients and their love of wordplay were first mentioned in [strip 37](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/37).

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Altort Einstoise and Agent 1028 are discussing. Einstoise says "So I bought some new updog, but it doesn't all fit into my henway. What should I do?" Agent 1028 answers "You should lubricate it properly. Then it will slip right in. Luckily, I have some excess snake oil..." and is then interrupted by a voice from the outside of the panel shouting "A dragon!"

Panel 2:

Captain Merriam-Webster comes into view. Agent 1028 asks them "Did you say 'a dragon', Captain?" The captain answers "Yes, there's a fucking dragon on my ship! And it wants gold!" Agent 1028 says "Obviously. Gold is to dragons like catnip is to demons. Or like fertilizer is to bananas. Or like wordplay was to the ancients. Or..."

Panel 3:

Altort Einstoise says "Or like licking my own cloaca is to me!" Both Agent 1028 and Captain Merriam-Webster look at them shocked and disgusted.
