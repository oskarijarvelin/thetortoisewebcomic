**2025-02-04:** We hadn't seen this happily married couple together since [their first meeting in strip 10](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/10)! It was about time.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater is standing on top of a larger-than-themself pile of clementines. They say to astonished-looking Spock "Look, my love, I got a bunch of clementines. They are ball-shaped. Me eat balls. Ergo, me eat all these clementines!"

Panel 2:

Looking worried, Spock elongates their limbs to rise to the level of their spouse, and says "Dearest, that's a lot of clementines. Beware of *delirium clemens*!" Ball-Eater answers "That's just a myth!"

Panel 3:

Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater is alone, with their (only visible) eye very much enlargened. They say "I am tripping balls!"
