**2025-07-08:** The second strip in a row with a new character. Soon there may be too many characters to keep track of.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: There's a meeting of bantering poets at The Noodle Restaurant! (Don't pay attention to Blasphemous B. Bible; they are there on unrelated business.)

Redcap is at a table with a plate of something green in front of them. At the other side of the table, with a similar plate, is Panurge, a tortoise with a purple beret, twirly mustache and a goatee. The hind half of Blasphemous B. Bible can be seen in the background. Redcap says "I'm thinking of writing an epic poem about the revolution." Panurge says "You always go with such grand themes. You need to write for the people, something more vulgar!", to which Redcap says "You would know about vulgar, Panurge!"

Panel 2:

Text box: Suddenly, a wave of realism sweeps over.

The panel is a photo of two tortoises eating some green leaves, with a third tortoise in the background.

Panel 3:

The setting is as in the first panel. Redcap says "Ugh, I hate those perhaps even more than the waves of surrealism. I despise the notion that I somehow lack realism." Panurge retorts "Well, based on your poems, that's exactly what you lack."
