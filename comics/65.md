**2025-07-29:** Dr. Human Smileyface always has such a positive attitude towards things!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Dr. Human Smileyface holds in his hand a pill larger than shrunken A Horse's head. He says to A Horse "No more ridiculously enormous syringes! Here, swallow this pill!" A Horse, whose purple color has somewhat faded, says "That pill is way too big for me!" Dr. Human says "I'll help you swallow it."

Panel 2:

The pill is in A Horse's mouth. Dr. Human is pushing it down with a large pole.

Panel 3:

A Horse's shell has enlarged back to its normal size, but their head, tail, and limbs stay tiny. Dr. Human says "Well, I'd call this a partial success." A Horse answers "After I kick your ass, you'll have only partial success sitting down on it!"
