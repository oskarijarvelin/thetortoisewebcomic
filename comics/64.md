**2025-07-23:** Well, I'm publishing this strip a bit late, after midnight. Sorry about that, if you were waiting for it!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: While their other partners are having shrunken adventures together, Spock and Captain Yrjö-Koskinen spend some rare quality time together:

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen (the force ghost) says "Give me a kiss, Spock!" Spock answers "Make me."

Text box: Spock actually wants to kiss the Captain, they are just being a brat as is their role in their relationship.

Panel 2:

With a "glomp" sound, Captain takes Spock's upper face in their mouth, putting their own jaw in Spock's mouth. Altort Einstoise appears, saying "I'm sorry to interrupt an amorous and/or cannibalistic moment, but another one of my revolution-era nonlethal weapons has disappeared!"

Panel 3:

Altort Einstoise says "This time it is my reverse-anti-de-enlarger thingamajig." Spock asks "Couldn't it just be called a shrinker-thingamajig?", to which EInstoise answers "Well, now that you say it... yes." Captain looks sad.
