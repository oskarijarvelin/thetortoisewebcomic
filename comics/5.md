**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Two human characters, Dr. Human Smileyface and a sad-looking patient.

The patient says: "Help me, doctor! I have a testicular tortoise!"

Panel 2:

Doctor Smileyface asks: "Don't you mean torsion?"

Unzipping his pants, the patient says: "No, look!"

Panel 3:

Text box: "Zoom:"

Close-up drawing of a scrotum, with tortoise number 1029 biting on one testicle and thinking: "Me. Eat. Balls."
