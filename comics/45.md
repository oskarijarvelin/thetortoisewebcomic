**2025-03-11:** I am really happy how that middle panel turned out. Very action-y!

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "In Hell:"

Tortoise President says to Agent 1028, Tortoise Newstortoise, and Catopus, "I hope you have a plan for an immediate escape, because I see a demon approaching with the apparent intent of beginning my eternal punishment!" Agent 1028 responds "You all run to TSS In Medias Res, I'll handle the demon."

Panel 2:

Agent 1028, smiling, pours snake oil from a barrel to the ground. A demon, carrying a bottle of hot sauce and an enema bulb syringe, slips on the snake oil, falling backwards.

Panel 3:

Agent 1028 is going to TSS In Medias Res behind Tortoise Newstortoise, and says "Let's make haste before the demons make our eyeballs into pincushions or something like that!"
