**2025-12-16:** Finally we get to actually see Dr. V. Eternal! She was first mentioned in [strip 29](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/29), although not by name, and then in [strip 31](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/31).

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: Catopus is visiting her vet, Dr. V. Eternal, for a pregnancy checkup.

Dr. V. Eternal, an anthropomorphic elephant, says to Catopus "The images confirm it: there is a tiny monster growing inside you." Catopus responds "What a delightfully horrible way of describing pregnancy!"

Panel 2:

Dr. Eternal says "To be honest, I am no expert of prenatal care. As you know, I mostly treat angels. They lay eggs like hens! Daily, mostly unfertilized." Catopus says "I don't count it against you, doctor!"

Panel 3:

Dr. Eternal says "By the way, there is a member of the press waiting outside. Is there something scandalous about your pregnancy?" Catopus answers "Nah, that's just the reluctant godparent. I forced them to come with me."
