**2025-08-05:** [Blue Banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana) is a supposed megalopolis in Europe. It has nothing to do with this strip.

Transcription:

Panel 1:

T'Pisang, a blue banana with eyebrows, greets Spock, saying "Spock, your favorite half-vulcan half-banana half-sister is here!" Spock exclaims "T'Pisang!"

Panel 2:

Spock asks "How are you here? I thought you were still in a banana prison for your cannibalistic tendencies!" T'Pisang says "It's not a tendency, let alone tendencies in plural. I only ate a banana once!" Spock adds "And a Vulcan thrice", to which T'Pisang retorts "But it was the same Vulcan every time! I only nibbled little pieces."

Panel 3:

T'Pisang says "Anyway, I got out by promising I'll go to therapy regularly." Spock says "Oh, I also go to therapy for my anger issues." T'Pisang rejoices "I'm glad that we as a family are healing. Did you hear Watto is getting help for his gambling problem?"
