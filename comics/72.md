**2025-09-16:** Yes, humans canonically have five fingers per hand. This isn't The Simpsons!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Dr. Human Smileyface is speaking with A Horse, whose head, limbs, and tail are tiny, and who is slightly less purple than the last time they were shown. Dr. Human says "Let's do some cognitive tests to make sure my experimental medicine hasn't caused neural damage. How many fingers am I holding up?", while holding up all three of the fingers drawn on his hand. A Horse answers "All five of them." Dr. Human exclaims "Correct!"

Panel 2:

Dr. Human asks "Next question: who is the president?" A Horse answers "No one. We recently did an anarchist revolution." Dr. Human says "Oh! I didn't know that."

Panel 3:

Dr. Human asks "Last question: can you count backwards from million to one?" A Horse answers "Yes, but it would take a very long time." Dr. Human admits "Yeah, I'm stalling for time to invent new medication for you."
