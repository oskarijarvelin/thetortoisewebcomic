**2025-09-23:** Last couple of days I have been programming my game Golem: A Self-Made Person! after a long break. Maybe soon I'll publish Alpha 4.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

A demon approaches King Satan and says (in blackletter, like all speech in this strip) "News for King Stan!" Satan looks angry and says "That's not my name anymore! I'm called Satan!" The demon apologizes, saying "Sorry, I'm new here."

Panel 2:

The demon says "Anyway, to solve their shrinking problem, tortoises have brought a human from the past! Our spies say he's called 'Docter Hunam Sniliefaes'." Satan smiles.

Panel 3:

Satan smiles and says "He may be the last human ever. I want his soul!" The demon asks "But why, your majesty?" Satan answers "Well, why does anyone want anything? Because it would make me happy! Also, it would make Trinity jealous."
