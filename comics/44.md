**2025-03-04:** What can we infer about vulcan appearance based on half-vulcans Spock and Watto? Probably that they are blue, have eyebrows and no horns.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "Mos Eisley, Vulcan:"

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen (the force ghost) is talking to Watto (the Star Wars character). The captain asks "Will you sell that metacausal navigation system and those self-sealing stem bolts for 20 000 Tortugan dollars, stol- I mean, expropriated from the bourgeoisie?" Watto answers "Bleh, your currency will lose all its value after your revolution is successful."

Panel 2:

The captain waves their front limb and says (in italics) "You will accept Tortugan dollars." Watto says "I am half vulcan half demon. Your Jedi/Sith mind tricks don't work on me!" Text box: "Mind tricks actually do work on Watto. The captain is just bad at doing them."

Panel 3:

The captain says "If you don't accept, I'll tell your mother!" Watto asks "How do you know her and why would she care?" The captain explains "Your half-sibling Spock is my first officer and lover!" Watto says "Well okay, but Spock can forget about  getting Christmas chocolates from me!"
