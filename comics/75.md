**2025-10-07:** The pants were first shown in [strip 23](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/23). Their purpose and structure was explained in [strip 50](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/50).

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Text box: Behold! It's God-Empress Trinity, the ruler of Heaven and the creator of Earth, the supreme deity of the universe, the eater of the divine marshmallows, etc.

God-Empress Trinity (who looks like Trinity from Matrix) holds a gift package and speaks every language simultaneously, saying "A gift from Stanley\*! How nice!"

Text box: \*Deadnaming King Satan

Panel 2:

Trinity found magenta pants from the package and has her leg in one of the pant legs and her arm in the other. She says "Home-knitted pants! But how am I supposed to...?"

Panel 3:

The pants form many forks and loops, now also covering Trinity's head. She screams "Angels, help!"
