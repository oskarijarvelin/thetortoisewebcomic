**2025-07-15:** Does Tortoise Newstortoise sleep with their hat on?

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: Catopus is at Tortoise Newstortoise's door in the middle of the night.

Tortoise Newstortoise says to Catopus "Catopus, you monster, what are you doing at my door in the middle of the night?" Catopus answers "I'm pregnant." Newstortoise further inquires "What am I to do with this information?"

Panel 2:

Catopus says "If I raise my child here in the past, I may become my own ancestor!" Newstortoise asks "Have I ever told you that you are a freak?" Catopus answers "Several times.", to which Newstortoise says "Good."

Panel 3:

Catopus asks "Anyway, will you be the godparent?" Newstortoise says "You seem to have severely misunderstood our relationship." Catopus asks "Is that a yes?" In turn, Newstortoise asks "Would a yes let me go back to sleep?" Catopus says "Splendid! We have a deal!" Newstortoise protests "Wait, I didn't -"
