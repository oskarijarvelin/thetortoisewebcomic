**2023-06-13:** For whom is he knitting those pants? He doesn't seem to wear any himself.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Altort Einstoise is pointing to a blackboard with a chalk and says "To dezombify your corpse, we must find out why it got zombified in the first place. It's all in the details!" The blackboard has a phallus symbol drawn on it, along with large text starting the word "dezombification" and smaller unintelligible text.

Panel 2:

At the other end of the blackboard, Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen says "You know what else is in the details? THE DEVIL!" The blackboard has the end of the word "dezombification", smaller unintelligible text and a vulva symbol drawn on it.

Panel 3:

Text box: "In the details:"

King Satan the Lightbringer is knitting pink pants and says "Don't mind me, I'm just knitting."
