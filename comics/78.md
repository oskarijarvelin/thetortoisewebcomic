**2025-10-29:** Spock has so many questions.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Spock, who is still tiny, asks Shrink "Who else knows of your secret identity?" Shrink answers "Your mother, Agent 1028, and of course Allah (SWT). Oh, and my strawberry dealer, Big Mike!"

Panel 2:

Spock asks "As you are my parent, shouldn't you disqualify yourself from being my therapist?" Shrink answers "Nonsense! We will solve your problem together! As the saying goes, family is like herpes - you can't get rid of it." Spock says "That's not a real saying."

Panel 3:

Spock says "Well then, let's therapize me. By the way, where's the therapy ball? I haven't seen it in a couple of sessions." Shrink says "Your spouse came and ate it. An impressive feat considering the size difference."
