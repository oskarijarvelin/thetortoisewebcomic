**2023-02-21:** Last week I had some technical issues and couldn't upload a comic. But here we go again!

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Agent 1028 is standing and looking sad. Behind them is Tortoise Newstortoise with a microphone, standing on the ground because the news box was lost to the revolution.

Agent 1028 thinks: "So the murder plot was a ruse, but now the president has been kidnapped, and I have been framed. Also, even worse, that reporter pesters me for an interview!"

Newstortoise says: "Just a few questions, agent!"

Panel 2:

Agent 1028 puts sunglasses on, while leaving their serial number still very visible. Sounds of revolution are heard in the background.

Agent 1028 thinks: "I can use these sunglasses as a surprisingly effective disguise!"

Newstortoise thinks: "Who is that?"

Panel 3:

Text box: "However, some foes can see your soul even through sunglasses! Non sequitur:"

Three demons, creatures with fangs and long snouts and red eyes, horns, wings, and tails, are attacking agent 1028, who punches one of them with an elongated front limb, kicks another with an elongated back limb and shoots the third one with a pistol.

Agent 1028 thinks: "Where did these demons come from and why do they attack me?"
