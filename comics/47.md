**2025-03-25:** My personal theory of time travel says that there is one, immutable timeline. My characters, however, seem to think otherwise, believing that the past can be changed. I guess only time will tell who is right (I wish I could say the pun was intended).

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

A demon approaches King Satan the Lightbringer, yellow liquid dripping from their backside. King Satan says, in blackletter, "Demon, you seem to be dripping snake oil on my floor. You'd better have something important to say!" The demon explains, also in blackletter, "Your majesty, tortoise agent 1028 has smuggled a freshly damned soul (and its Hell-provided postmortal body) out from Hell!"

Panel 2:

King Satan looks angry and says, still in blackletter, "Damn it! This is unacceptable. I'll send three demons back in time (to strip 12) to prevent this from happening."

Panel 3:

Text box: "In the past (right after strip 12):"

Agent 1028 points a pistol at a sitting demon, asking "Why did you attack me?" The demon answers, in blackletter as always, "Because in the future you will steal the dead Tortoise President from Hell!" To that the Agent says "Now that's a nice idea! I wish I'd come up with it myself!"
