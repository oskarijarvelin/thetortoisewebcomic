**2024-10-29:** Considering their dislike of bolsheviks, why does Captain Yrjö-Koskinen wear a hat like that? Is it a weird personal style choice, or do all turtle captains wear such hats?

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen is floating in the air and pointing forwards, and says "Behold, professor! There's my zombie!" Below them, professor Altort Einstoise holds a zombie gurgle translator thingamajig, a device with many small buttons and a wiggly funnel-shaped receiver. They say "I'll translate its gurglings with my zombie gurgle translator thingamajig!"

Panel 2:

The zombie of Captain Yrjö-Koskinen is green, has an x for eye and has two bullet holes on their shell. They say "Grrllh..." which is translated as "Socialism can only be achieved by a state controlled by a vanguard party. The working class is too stupid to control itself. But worry not, this time the dictatorship of the proletariat shall be humane and only temporary, I swear!"

Text box: "Zombie gurgles pack information very densely."

Panel 3:

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen (the force ghost) looks horriied and says "Oh damnfucking dickshit, my zombie is a bolshevik!" Below them, Proessor Einstoise has dropped the thingamajig and says "Let's run before we get infected!"
