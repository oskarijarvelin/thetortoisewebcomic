**2024-12-31:** Happy new year from The Tortoise Webcomic! The cyrillic translitteration site I used made some weird choices, but let's pretend that's fun.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Catopus is talking with an angel; a pile of eyes with six wings and a halo. The angel says "Do not be afraid!" as a greeting, as it is the only thing it can say in Tortuguese. Catopus says (in cyrillic script with multiocular O's) "Hello! We would like to acquire one of your hairs". The angel answers, in similar manner, "You buy three barrels of snake oil, you also get one hair".

Panel 2:

Catopus says to Agent 1028 "The angel says you have to buy three barrels\* of snake oil to get one hair from him." The agent answers "What am I going to do with that much snake oil?!"

Text box: "\*See [https://github.com/SurrealPartisan/Better-Unit-System"](https://github.com/SurrealPartisan/Better-Unit-System")

Panel 3:

Text box: "Later:"

Agent 1028 is at the Noodle Restaurant speaking to Noodles: "Would you like to buy a shitload of snake oil? You can fry food in it!" Noodles say "We ares afred of smakes. Amd shitlodes." The agent answers "Understandable. Have a nice day."
