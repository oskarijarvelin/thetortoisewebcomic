**2023-01-16:** Last week you didn't get a strip due to illness, this week you get one a day early due to me being busy tomorrow. I try to keep a consistent schedule, but sometimes life gets in the way.

Also: yes, polycule. Spock and the Captain are totally dating!

Also also: I point out my own verbosity, but this is not even the most verbose I can get. You will see! \*Evil laughter\*

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen stands on the back of a horse-like creature and exclaims: "Behold, Spock! I have bought A HORSE!"

Spock looks surprised and confused.

Panel 2:

Spock says: "Captain, that is a very large tortoise with a long face and a mohawk."

The horse-like tortoise says: "My name is A Horse."

Spock continues: "Tortoise ownership is illegal."

Text box: "The next panel is way too verbose."

Panel 3:

The Captain says: "First, with the disappearance of the Tortoise President, we now live in anarchism where laws don't apply. Second: please don't kinkshame, Spock."

Text box: "Technically, the first argument is invalid. The laws are enforced with or without the President. Also, chattel slavery is an unjust power structure, against the principles of anarchism. However, in The Tortoise Webcomic we indeed do not kinkshame, so this is settled. Welcome to the TSS Anthropic Principle polycule, A Horse!"
