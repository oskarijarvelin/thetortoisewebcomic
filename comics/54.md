**2025-05-13:** You may have seen the same meme Spock and I saw, the one about Lincoln ordering a mass execution of Dakota people. [Well, this link shows that the truth is more complicated.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lincoln-dakota/) So, Spock's actions here may not be as justified as they think.

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Spock and Catopus approach Abraham Lincoln. Spock says "Mr. President, I am Spock and this is Catopus. Catopus wants to take you back to your own time. However, I have a surprise."

Panel 2:

Spock shoots Lincoln in the head with a pistol, shouting "This is for the mass execution of Dakota people!" Catopus looks surprised.

Panel 3:

Catopus, looking more somber than usual, says "You know, maintaining the timeline is hard work even without shenanigans like this!" Spock answers "Well boo hoo, bootlicker!" Next to them, Abraham Lincoln lies dead.
