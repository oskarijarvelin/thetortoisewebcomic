**2023-05-02:** So the Star Trek movies apparently exist also in the tortoise world (after the human extinction). But is our Spock the character from the movies or did they just name themself after the character?

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

The force ghost of Captain Yrjö-Koskinen floats in the air and says "...and that's how we found out that the planet of apes was actually Earth!"

A Horse says "Fascinating". Behind A Horse's back, Spock clears their throat.

Panel 2:

A Horse turns towards Spock and says "Oh, I'm sorry, Spock. Did I accidentally use your catchphrase?"

Spock answers "Not everything is like in movies. My catchphrase is 'I am Spock'. Anyway, I came to tell that the Captain's corpse has turned into a zombie."

Panel 3:

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen stands atop the sad-looking A Horse and says "Oh damnfuck. I thought force ghosts don't leave corpses behind."

Spock answers "Again, not everything is like in movies."
