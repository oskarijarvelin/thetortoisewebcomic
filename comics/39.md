**2025-01-28:** The switch was first mentioned in [strip 17](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/17), but now we see it for the first time. And soon we will see what it is used for.

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Text box: "The Chamber of Tortoise Politicians, Hell:"

Agent 1028 is leading a group consisting of Catopus and Tortoise Newstortoise, and says "So, this is where all our politicians come after they die." Catopus says "My favorite bar is nearby. They serve the most authentic cocktail of boiling blood and piss" to which Newstortoise comments "Freak".

Panel 2:

Agent 1028 turns towards the others and says "Now, who wants to be the one to flick the switch? It isn't dangerous, I think" Catopus says "I think Tortoise Newstortoise should do it", to which Newstortoise responds "Well I think Catopus should do it!" Catopus retorts "I said it first" which makes Newstortoise say "Jerk".

Panel 3:

Catopus is outside the frame, taking selfies with the demons torturing dead politicians. Agent 1028 holds the switch, a device with a big red button and an angel hair antenna, and says "This thing has just one button, a big and red one. When I say 'push the button', you push the button". Tortoise Newstortoise asks "Could I get those instructions in writing?"
