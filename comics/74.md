**2025-09-30:** Personally, I like this kind of strips that show some action instead of just having the characters talk.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Catopus is behind Tortoise Newstortoise and says "Hey Tortoise Newstortoise, look here!" Newstortoise looks a bit puzzled.

Panel 2:

With Newstortoise now facing towards Catopus, Catopus rises her other side to the air, exposing her bottom side to Newstortoise, and squirts something dark brown from between her tentacles towards Newstortoise. Newstortoise looks horrified.

Panel 3:

Newstortoise, now covered with the dark gbrown stuff, asks "Eww! Is this ink?" Catopus says "One would think so, but actually it's shit!" Newstortoise screams "EWW! Why? WHY?! Eww!"

Text box: Yes, this is the same comic that handles topics like theology, self-causing time-loops, and transformative justice. I have range!
