**2025-10-21:** I designed the font for dragon speech myself. It is horrible, but I think it has the correct vibe.

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Captain Merriam-Webster talks to themself, saying "Negotiating with those banana diplomats sure made me hungry. I wonder if we have any non-sentient fruit... Wait! Why does it smell like dragon on my ship?" A voice from the outside of the panel says, in a very heavy and blocky font, "IT IS I".

Panel 2:

Captain Merriam-Webster meets a dragon (an approximately tortoise-sized green reptile with wings) and asks it "Who are you? What do you want?" The dragon says, in the aforementioned blocky font, "I AM ORION" and further "GIVE ME GOLD".

Panel 3:

Captain Merriam-Webster says "I'm afraid I don't have any gold." Orion the dragon says "I WILL BURN EVERYTHING YOU LOVE". Captain exclaims "Oh no!"
