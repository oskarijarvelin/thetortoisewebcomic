**2025-06-17:** Hiding a clone for almost six decades! What other secrets may Prof. Einstoise and their fellow tortoises have?

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Altort Einstoise, followed by a clone of Abraham Lincoln, approaches Catopus and says "Here's the clone of Abraham Lincoln you ordered, Catopus." Catopus exclaims "Wow, that was quick!"

Panel 2:

Eistoise says "Quick? Are you kidding me? I have been raising the clone ever since you brought me the DNA sample and the instructions 55 years ago." Catopus says "Oh! Umm, right. I'll be sure to do that ASAP." Einstoise continues "Also I have kept him secret since you didn't want to risk the paradox of Spock shooting him before and instead of the original."

Panel 3:

The clone Lincoln and Catopus shake hands (or in the case of Catopus, a tentacle). Lincoln says "I have been studying all aspects of Abraham Lincoln's life up to year 1864. I am curious to see how my life will turn out the decades following that since I start impersonating him." Catopus answers "Excellent! Let's go."
