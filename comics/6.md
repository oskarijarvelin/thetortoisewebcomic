**2022-12-27:** The Secret Service is secret, but not *that* secret.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Music plays: "Ta-da-da-da-daa - The Tortoise News!"

Tortoise Newstortoise is standing atop The News Box and interviewing tortoise labeled 1028.

Newstortoise asks: "Agent 1028 of the Secret Service, Our viewers want to know: Where is the Tortoise President?"

The other tortoise looks puzzled.

Panel 2:

The tortoise that was labeled 1028 wipes their shell with a very elongated front limb and a green towel, saying: "I'm sorry, is there some confusing smudge on my shell? Let me wipe it off. I am not Agent 1028, I am The Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater."

Tortoise Newstortoise looks puzzled.

Panel 3:

Tortoise Newstortoise says: "Oh, my bad. I should have realized that, considering that from my point of view your two-dimensionality is obvious."

Text box: "But where are Agent 1028 and the Tortoise President? Also, how do tortoise limbs even work? One of these questions will be answered in the next strip!"
