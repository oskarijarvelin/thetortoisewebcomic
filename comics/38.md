**2025-01-21:** If you don't remember why the Great Necromancer was in halves, check out [strip 15](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/15). Also, this is the second strip where a frontal view of a tortoise is shown, the previous one being [strip 4](https://thetortoisewebcomic.net/comics/4).

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Blasphemous B. Bible is carrying a bottled soul on their horns and says to the zombie of Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen "I bring gifts from Hell! The soul and the sewer demon you asked for. I left the demon outside as he smells like sewer". The zombie answers "Hurgl...", translated as "Diabolism may be the highest stage of capitalism, but our diabolism is different!"

Panel 2:

Text box: "The sewer demon sews together two halves long since separated..."

A demon that smells like sewer is sewing together a tortoise with a thread.

Text box: "...and the soul, released from the bottle, once again possesses its old body..."

Panel 3:

Text box: "...and so, the Great Necromancer is back!"

Frontal view of the Great Necromancer, showing a seam in the middle. They say, smiling, "Buenas tardes, senior citizen! (The opposite of 'Hasta la vista, baby!')"
