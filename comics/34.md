**2024-12-24:** The Tortoise Webcomic wishes merry Christmas to those who celebrate Christmas and happy holidays to those who have holidays! [Here's my favorite Christmas song for you to enjoy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CeY0VdhXK8)

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

A whole-panel text box: "As you know, the vast majority of tortoises is non-Christian. However, due to the long history of cultural imperialism, many of them still celebrate Christmas or some related tradition. Here's what some members of the TSS Anthropic Principle polycule have to say about the topic."

Panel 2:

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen says "In the Jedi/Sith religion it is called the Life Day (see the Star Wars Holiday Special)". Spock says "I don't care about the name or the background of the celebration, but, Inshallah, I shall eat all the chocolates".

Panel 3:

A Horse has fake antlers on their head and says "Usually I am A Horse, but during this season I am A Reindeer!" Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater says "I just love Christmas carols like 'Jingle Balls' and 'Deck the Balls'".
