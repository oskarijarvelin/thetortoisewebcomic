**2025-12-10:** Even though Tiny Zombie Tortoise doesn't have anything painted on their shell, they are easily recognizable by the fact that they truly are a tiny zombie tortoise.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

A tiny zombie tortoise approaches Great Necromancer, who has a bowl of mayonnaise in front of them and has just put a spoon in their mouth. The tiny zombie tortoise says "Gugurr...", translated as "I have been shrunken! I am now Tiny Zombie Tortoise". Great Necromancer looks puzzled.

Panel 2:

Great Necromancer points the spoon at Tiny Zombie Tortoise and asks "What were you called before? I have forgotten". Tiny Zombie Tortoise answers "Hurh...", translated as "Pope Francis LXIX". Looking amused, Great Necromancer says "Well, at least namewise this is an improvement then". The mayonnaise in the bowl has changed its color to blue for an unknown reason.

Panel 3:

Great Necromancer says "If everyone was tiny, we would save so much in food costs!" Tiny Zombie Tortoise answers "Urr...", translated as "No! I want to be special!" Great Necromancer sticks the spoon in the bowl of mayonnaise, looks down making a surprised face and asks "Now what is going on with my mayonnaise?"
