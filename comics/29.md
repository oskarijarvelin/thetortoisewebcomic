**2024-11-12:** A bilingual strip, yay! If there seem to be any mistakes in the Sbananish text, it's just because it isn't Spanish, but a language of its own, I swear!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Catopus is pointing a pistol at a tied-up banana, who looks displeased. Behind Catopus, Agent 1028 says "Tell it to answer our questions or it will know what a banana split is!" Catopus says, in Sbananish, endonymously esbanañol, "Responde nuestras preguntas o vas a saber que es un banana split."

Panel 2:

Agent 1028 asks "Is the switch in this facility?" Catopus translates "¿El interruptor está en esta instalación?" The banana says "Sí, pero no está lista. Necesita un pelo de un ángel para la antena.", which Catopus again translates as "Yes, but it still needs an angel hair for the antenna."

Panel 3:

It's just the Agent and Catopus, the banana is no longer seen.

Agent 1028 says "Do angels even have hair? I thought they were just eyes and wings. Lots of them." Catopus says "Contrary to the popular belief, they do have pubic hair." The agent asks "How do you know that?", and Catopus answers "We go to the same vet."
