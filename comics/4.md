**2022-12-13:** There's no risk of someone thinking these two are the same tortoise. After all, they are often seen together in the same room (standing next to each other in identical positions). Also, they do have different serial numbers.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "These two tortoises might look identical except for their differing serial numbers, but in fact there are many subtle differences."

Two tortoises pictured from the side, one labeled 1028 and the other 1029, in a very blocky font.

Panel 2:

Text box: "For example, from a frontal view it becomes obvious that one of them is in fact two-dimensional, while the other possesses all the typical spatial dimensions:"

The tortoises are pictured from the front. Tortoise 1028 looks normal, whereas tortoise 1029 is just a vertical line.

Panel 3:

Text box: "Also, their most private personal thoughts are different:"

Tortoise 1028 thinks: "So I know that someone is planning to kill the Tortoise President. Now I have to decide whether I want to prevent this or betray my oaths and join the plan."

Tortoise 1029 thinks: "Meatballs. Me. Eat. Balls. Hehe, balls"
