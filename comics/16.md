**2023-03-28:** I considered making a [Casey an Andy](http://www.galactanet.com/comic/index.php "Casey and Andy") reference by having the demon say "rend flesh", but for some reason I didn't.

Transcript:

Panel 1:

Text box: "Demons. Due to self-esteem issues, king Satan the Lightbringer wanted to mutate his angelic followers into something absolutely uncool to emphasize his own coolness. However..."

A picture of a demon.

Panel 2:

Text box: "Take a closer look at that snout!"

An extreme zoom to the demon's snout. Cruel Angel's Thesis (or whatever your favorite iteration of the meme is) starts playing.

Panel 3:

A full-panel text box: "The snout of a demon resembles the proboscis of an elephant or a tapir. Elephants and tapirs are extremely cool. Thus, king Satan failed in his attempt to create something uncool."
