**2025-05-20:** A white lie! Will it have consequences?

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen (the force ghost) says to A Horse, who is tiny, "A Horse, how are you so small? Usually you are very large." A Horse answers "It's just the perspective. I am actually very far away!"

Panel 2:

Captain says "Well that explains it. Another mystery solved! I'll go and reward myself by eating a cucumber." A Horse says "But how does a force ghost... Nevermind. Go and enjoy that cucumber."

Panel 3:

A Horse is alone and thinks "Phew! Now that Captain isn't uselessly worrying, I can myself focus on figuring out why I have shrunken and how to unshrink myself."
