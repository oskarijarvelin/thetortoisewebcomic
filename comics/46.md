**2025-03-18:** PSA for anyone reading The Tortoise Webcomic for life advice: none of the characters is a very good role model.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen (the force ghost) shouts "Beware, Spock! The tortoise-flipper robot is attacking!" However, the robot is already flipping Spock. It is a box with angry face, flying with two small whirring propellers, and has two long jointed limbs for flipping tortoises. Spock says "Captain, your warning comes way too late!"

Panel 2:

Altort Einstoise appears, shooting the robot with a green ray from some sort of pistol-shaped thingamajig, sayin "Take that, my foul creation!" The robot is surrounded by green energy and fades away. The Captain looks astonished. Spock, upside down, looks distressed.

Panel 3:

Spock asks "What did you do to it, Professor?" Altort Einstoise responds "I banished it to the future (to strip 103) with my involuntary-timetravel-thingamajig! It won't bother us for a while." Spock further inquires "Shouldn't you rather have destroyed it?", to which Altort says "Like we say in the academia, never do that today which you can postpone also tomorrow."
