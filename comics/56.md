**2025-05-27:** It is good that they found something honest to do, something that actually benefits the community.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Tortoise Newstortoise is on top of The News Box, and is interviewing Former Tortoise President, who has the word "Former" written above the word "PREZ" on their shell. Newstortoise asks "Former Tortoise President, what have you been doing since the revolution?" Former President answers "I have been focusing on my true passion, which is hats! I am now a hatmaker, fulfilling all the hat-related needs of our community members. Well, almost all, as there are some things I cannot do."

Panel 2:

Former Tortoise President says to the force ghost of Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen "While I fully sympathize with your wish to get a humongously large captain's hat, I don't know how to make force ghost hats. I am no necrohatter!" The Captain exclaims "Oh assdamn!"

Panel 3:

Former President says to Redcap "I'm sorry, Redcap, but I can't make you a cap any redder than your current one. It is already maximally red!" Redcap answers "Woe is me!"
