**2023-03-07:** The bartender also asked A Horse about the reasons for their face being so long.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "The crew of TSS Anthropic Principle is on shore leave in Hell:"

Spock is at a bar, saying "Barkeep, I am Spock. Give me a local special, please."

A demon bartender says "A cocktail of boiling blood and piss coming right up. How's the revolution?" while pouring the aforementioned substances into a glass where they form an orange mixture.

Spock answers "Bloody", to which the bartender says "Good".

Panel 2:

A Horse asks a Demon Jockey "DJ, could you play something happy?"

The DJ replies "More screams of the damned it is."

Panel 3:

Spock and A Horse are standing on the opposite sides of a table. The force ghost of Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen is standing on the back of A Horse. Spock is grabbing a glass of orange cocktail from the table, or perhaps putting it back. A Horse is gulping from another glass of the same substance. There is a third similar glass on the table.

Spock says "This is quite unpleasant.", to which the Captain replies "Tell me about it! It feels like I'm trespassing in another religion's afterlife while simultaneously afterliving my own!"

Spock says "I was mainly referring to the drink, but I do see your point."
