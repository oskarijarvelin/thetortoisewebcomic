**2025-05-06:** What is the problem of Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater? And why are they so tiny? Is the latter question the answer to the former? You will find out sooner or later. Also, as a muslim, they might prefer calling Noah Nuh, but for the sake of Dr. Human Smileyface they are using the western, Christian, form of the name.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: In the past (a bit after strip 5):

Dr. Human Smileyface, M.D. (not his real name) is holding Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater (who is tiny) by the tail. He says "My goodness, this tiny tortoise I removed from that man's testicles is completely flat!"

Panel 2:

Dr. Human holds 2D Ball-Eater over a medical waste bin and says "Well, to the trash with you!" Ball-Eater says "Spare me, fellow doctor! I only ate those balls to get into contact with you!\*"

Text box: \*A lie; they also had other reasons.

Panel 3:

Dr. Human says "Speak, little friend!" Ball-Eater, now on the ground, says "I come from the future! If you help me with my problem, I will take you with me and make you a new Noah. You and your family will survive the human extinction!"
