**2025-06-03:** I have some news! I have recently been designing a board game based on The Tortoise Webcomic. It's still in the playtesting phase, but after that and some graphic design and prototyping, it will be on sale online. How exciting!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: In the past (right after strip 53):

Tiny Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater tells Dr. Human Smileyface "Recently, I was tripping balls due to delirium clemens. When I came to my senses, I had shrunk into a miniature version of myself. I want to collaborate with you to get back to my normal size, Dr. Human Smileyface!"

Dr. Human Smileyface protests, smiling, "That's not my name." Ball-Eater quips "It is now." Dr. Human accepts it, saying "Well, okay."

Panel 2:

Ball-Eater tells the smiling human "Before I take you to the future, I need you to wear something distinctive. Like most tortoises, I have prosopagnosia, and I don't want to mistake you for some random time-traveling human!"

Panel 3:

Dr. Human wears a red tie with yellow circles and asks "How about a red tie with yellow circles?"

Ball-Eater answers "Perfect! I am fond of circular things."
