**2025-01-14:** To quote Todd Chavez from *Bojack Horseman*: "I was hoisted by my own petard! The one petard I thought would never hoist me!"

Transcription:

Panel 1:

Spock arrives to find professor Altort Einstoise flipped upside down. Spock asks "Professor, are you okay?" The professors says "I was moist with my own mustard..." Spock corrects them: "You mean 'hoist with my own petard'". "Is that how it goes?", the professors asks.

Panel 2:

While Spock is turning the professor over, the professor explains "We need nonlethal weapons, as we don't want to risk our enemies turning into zombies. Thus, I built a tortoise-flipper robot. But it got out of control! Now no one is safe!"

Panel 3:

Professor Einstoise says "This may be the flipocalypse foretold by the ancient prophecies!" (with the word "flipocalypse" written with a horror-themed font). Spock comments "The ancients sure loved wordplay", to which the professor says "Yes, it was their bread-and-butt."
