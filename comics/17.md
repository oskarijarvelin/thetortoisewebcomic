**2023-04-04: **Almost forgot to publish a strip again, but here you go!

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Agent 1028 points a pistol at an imprisoned banana soldier who is tied with ropes.

The agent says "Now tell me, where does your government keep the switch?"

The banana replies "¡No hablo tortugués!", to which the agent says "Damn."

Text box: "What "switch" are they even talking about?"

Panel 2:

Agent 1028 thinks "I need a polyglot. Someone who is neutral on tortoise politics. Someone hypercarnivorous enough to deal calmly with the bananas..."

Panel 3:

Agent 1028 talks to Catopus: "Catopus, I need you as an interpreter!"

Catopus says "Anything for you, my dear friend!"

The agent continues "I also need TSS In Medias Res."

Catopus replies "That will cost extra."
