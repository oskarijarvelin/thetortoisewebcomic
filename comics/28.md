**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "In a secret meeting, ambassador Blasphemous B. Bible makes a proposal:"

Blasphemous B. Bible says to the Noodles "Before, you spied the tortoises for Hell. Would you like to get back to the job, and not just moodle, Noodles? Will you again be my poodles, Noodles?". Noodles answer "Last tiem we gots inprisomed by the govermnemt."

Panel 2:

Blasphemous says "Don't be afraid of those whangdoodles, Noodles! You can focus on spying the anarchists. They don't believe in prisons! Besides, you will be paid oodles of boodle, Noodles! (As long as you bring information in caboodles, Noodles.)" To that, the Noodles exclaim "Is a deel!" and Blasphemous says "Great!"

Panel 3:

Blasphemous and Noodles are going away from each other, Noodles spreading their wings. Blasphemous says "Toodles, Noodles!" and Noodles say "So lomg!"
