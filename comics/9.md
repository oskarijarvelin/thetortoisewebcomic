**2023-01-24:** Trust me, I'm a scientist.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "An interview of Prof. Altort Einstoise:"

Tortoise Newstortoise stands atop A Substitute News Box (the main one is being fumigated). They are interviewing Altort Einstoise, a tortoise with light blueish grey messy hair and mustache: "A question, Professor Einstoise."

Prof. Einstoise answers "Ja?" and Newstortoise continues: "Could you tell the audience, what are the main principles of academic work?"

Panel 2:

Quite an extreme zoom to the face of Altort Einstoise, who says: "Vell, zat is simple. Zerrre arrre thrrree of zem:

\- Plagiarrrizazion

\- Delegazion

\- Masturrrbazion".

Panel 3:

Tortoise Newstortoise stands atop The News Box, which was returned from the fumigation during panel 2, and says: "Thank you, Professor."

Altort Einstoise says "You'rrre velcome."

Tortoise Newstortoise then continues: "Another question: why would a tortoise from Tortuga have a German human accent?"

Einstoise looks down, sad, and says: "I'm sorry, I thought it was funny. I'll stop doing it."
