**2025-08-19:** I've been thinking about poetry more than usual recently. Especially avantgarde poetry. I want to start an anarchist avantgarde group!

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Spock says to Redcap "Shrink told me I should be open about my feelings and not bottle them up, so here goes: your hat is ugly and your name is stupid!" Redcap responds "Alas! Your words wound me!"

Panel 2:

Text box: Suddenly:

With a loud "SHMP" sound, the two tortoises shrink down into tiny versions of themselves. Both have their mouths open because of the surprise.

Panel 3:

Spock yells "DAMMIT! DAMMIT! DAMMIT! I want to strangle someone!" Redcap says "Maybe some improvised poetry would calm you down:

A bastard called Spock,

that uncouth punk,

would my hat mock,

then we both shrunk!

Spock is an asshole,

but that's not new.

Now unshrinking is our goal.

Solutions, however, are few!"
