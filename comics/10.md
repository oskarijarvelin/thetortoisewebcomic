**2023-01-31:** The polycule just keeps getting larger! Love is beautiful.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Spock and The Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater are facing each other. Spock says: "I am Spock". The Ball-Eater responds: "Me. Eat. Balls".

Text box: "Sometimes two tortoises with strong catchphrases run into each other (at the polyamorous kinkster meetup of a biophysics conference)..."

Panel 2:

The two tortoises are smiling, and hearts are flying in the air.

Text box: "... and immediately fall in love. (Those pink things in the air are not upside-down butts, but metaphorical hearts.)"

Panel 3:

A full panel text box: "The last panel was supposed to be of their wedding, but the author does not know enough about the islamic wedding traditions to be able to illustrate them respectfully. So, just let it be known, that canonically Spock and The Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater, Ph.D., M.D. are now married (and also devout muslims, but that they have been all the time.) Alhamdulillah!"
