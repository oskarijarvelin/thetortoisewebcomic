**2025-01-07:** In case you have lost count, the four sides of the conflict are the government, the anarchists, the bolshevik zombies and the bananas.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "The Tortoise President holds tightly onto the control over the nation. Or do they?"

Tortoise President is lying upside down behind a box labveled "Control over the nation", wearing an upside down hat for upside down situations. On the other side of the box, Blasphemous B. Bible arrives, saying "Tortoise President, I bring the greetings of Hell... What the hell has happened here?" The president answers "I was taking an official nap and then woke up like this. Please help!"

Panel 2:

With elongated front limbs, Blasphemous B. Bible turns the President over. The President says "Carefully, carefully... By the way, which side does Hell support in the revolutionary conflict?"

Text box with the face of Tortoise Newstortoise: "'Breaking clickbait news: The forces of Hell have overturned the tortoise government!'"

Panel 3:

Blasphemous B. Bible says "The Rebel Kingdom actively supports all four sides. We like conflict!" Tortoise President says to that "Well, at least you are honest about it". B. B. Bible exclaims "The Prince of Lies and his followers always tell the truth!"
