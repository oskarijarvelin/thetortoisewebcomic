**2025-02-25:** This strip is supposed to explain pretty much everything, but my test readers were quite confused by it.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "In Hell:"

Tortoise President appears from nowhere in between of Agent 1028 and Catopus with a popping sound. Agent 1028 says "There you are, Mx. Prez! I'm sorry we had to kill you with the banana-made killswitch, but it was the only way to get you where we are, since you were kidnapped. Now, who took you?" The President answers "You idiots! I am the president you brought from the past, not the kidnapped one!" The agent wonders "What?! Where is the other one, then?" Catopus says "I can explain."

Panel 2:

Text box: "In the past, right after strip 26:"

A bright flash is accompanied by a loud "BURP" sound, when a time- and spaceship disappears. Agent 1028 (without the sunglasses) thinks " I just saw someone looking just like me, but with suspicious-looking sunglasses, taking away the Tortoise President! I think someone is framing me for a kidnapping!"

Panel 3:

Catopus explains "I am a time cop from the future. I came to make sure this self-causing loop happens." Tortoise president says "I would have expected a time cop to rather prevent this kind of situations." Catopus confesses "To be honest, we time cops do pretty much whatever we want to."
