**2023-02-28:** Multiple media references again. The one in the first panel is very obscure. The one in the second panel is poorly made.

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Text box: "Comrades fighting back to back for the revolution:"

Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen is facing left, shooting with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and shouting "Die, you fascists! ...Oh assturd, I'm going to die myself! This sucks!"

Behind the Captain's back, Spock is facing right, shooting with two pistols and shouting "I am Spock!"

A bullet is heading towards the Captain.

Panel 2:

The captain lies dead, with two bloody holes in their shell. Spock looks horrified, shouting "Dammit, Captain! You are dead!"

Panel 3:

The Captain appears faded and glowing and says: "Don't worry, Spock. As a follower of the Jedi/Sith faith, I get to be a force ghost!"

Spock says: "Are you becoming a wise mentor character, only appearing sometimes to give advice?"

The Captain answers: "Nah, I think I'll live like I have thus far. Although I might increase the amount of unsolicited advice I give."

Spock says: "Dammit."
