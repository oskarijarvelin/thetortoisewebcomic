**2025-04-29:** Remember, all cops being bastards is not about the actions of individual cops, it's about the principles they implicitly accept as part of their job description.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Text box: It is known that all cops are bastards. But how does this apply to...

Text box: ...Secret agents?

Agent 1028 says "Now that we live in an anarchist society, the agent thing is just an aesthetic choice. I am a communal solver of conflicts and mysteries. Also, on the side I am a snake oil distributor. At least that is honest work!"

Panel 2:

Text box: ...Turtle captains?

The force ghost of Captain Yrj√∂-Koskinen says "It is true that formerly I had the duty to assist the police if needed. Luckily, the first time I was asked to was during the revolution, when I had already chosen my side. Nowadays, I handle foreign relations and protect the community from external threats. Being a captain is a position of responsibility, not of power. I answer to my crew and to the whole community. However, anarchism is a learning process, and every day I pursue being less of a bastard than the day before."

Panel 3:

Text box: ...Time cops?

Catopus says "I'm a bastard!"
