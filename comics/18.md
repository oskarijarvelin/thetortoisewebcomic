**2023-04-11:** Whatever the noodles were accused of, I'm sure they were innocent!

**Transcript:**

Panel 1:

Spock speaks with Redcap, a tortoise with a red cap on their head.

Spock says "Redcap, for the revolution you must free the noodles. For too long has the government kept them imprisoned!"

Redcap responds "Aye, subcomandante Spock!"

Panel 2:

Text box: "After fighting the government soldiers:"

Redcap uses pliers to cut a chain shackling a pile of noodles, and says "You are free!"

Panel 3:

The pile of noodles flaps its wings and says "Thamks".

Text box: "Noodles do not speak very well. However, that is not the reason the tortoise government kept them imprisoned."
