**2025-09-09: **Well, I guess it's better than for example finding out that Darth Vader is your father.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Shrink holds up a piece of paper with something dark yellow on it and asks shrunken Spock "Okay, Spock, what do you see in this picture?" Spock answers "A blot of... is it mustard?" Shrink says "Correct! This was the wrapper for my lunch."

Panel 2:

This time shrink holds up a piece of paper with something black and blue on it and asks "What about this one?" Spock exclaims "What the fuck? That's you having sex with my mother!" Shrink says "Correct! Spock, I am your parent." Spock complains "I'm sure you could have found a less graphical way of telling me." Shrink says "Well, this is how we psychologists do it."

Panel 3:

Spock asks "How didn't I recognize you?" Shrink answers "My identity and appearance have been changed in a witness protection program. Also, you have prosopagnosia."
