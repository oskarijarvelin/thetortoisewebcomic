**2024-12-17:** Being stuck upside down is such a classical tortoise trope that it's a wonder I haven't used it before.

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Spock is lying upside down. Captain Yrjö-Koskinen is floating in the air next to them. Spock says "Help me Captain, I am Spock. Err, I mean stuck!" The Captain says "I can't, I have no physical body." To this, Spock says "Use the force!" The Captain says "Nah, can't be bothered. I'll tell A Horse to help you."

Text box: "Of course, Spock could use their malleable limbs to help themself. However, that would be cheating."

Panel 2:

Captain Yrjö-Koskinen arrives to see A Horse alos lying upside down. The Captain asks "You too, A Horse?" A Horse says "We promised the revolution would turn everything upside down. Is this it? Did we win?" The Captain says "I'll find Redcap."

Panel 3:

The Captain arrives to see also Redcap lying upside down, their hat fallen, and asks "What is happening here?!" Redcap answers "I don't know. I dreamt I was a pancake, and then I woke up like this, flipped. Do we have any maple syrup?"

Text box: "Who or what is flipping tortoises?"
