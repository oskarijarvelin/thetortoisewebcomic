**2025-06-24:** A purple tortoise, a turtle porpoise(?).

**Transcription:**

Panel 1:

Dr. Human Smileyface is talking to two tiny tortoises, A Horse and Two-Dimensional Ball-Eater. He says "I'll attempt to treat A Horse first, as I still have to figure out how drug dosage for two-dimensional beings works." Ball-Eater protests "But Dr. Smileyface, I am so small I can barely eat balls! You have to help me immediately!", to which Dr. Smileyface says "Be patient, patient."

Panel 2:

"Here you go, one dose of experimental anti-shrinking medicine!", says Dr. Smileyface while giving the medicine to A Horse with a ridiculously enormous syringe for such a small patient.

Panel 3:

A Horse turns purple. Dr. Smileyface says "Oops! Instead of making you large again, I seem to have turned you purple. Let's hope the color fades over time." A Horse exclaims "Oh no!" Ball-Eater says "Maybe I am not in such a hurry after all. I prefer my natural tortoise coloring."
